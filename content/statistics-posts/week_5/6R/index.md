## 6_R assignament

### Request

Think and explain in your own words what is the role that probability plays in Statistics and the relation between the observed distribution and frequencies their "theoretical" counterparts. Do some practical examples where you explain how the concepts of an abstract probability space relate to more "concrete" and "real-world" objects when doing statistics.
