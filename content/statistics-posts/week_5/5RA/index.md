## 5_RA assignament

### Request

Do a web research about the various methods to generate, from a Uniform([0,1)), all the most important random variables (discrete and continuous). Collect all source code you think might be useful code of such algorithms (keep credits and attributions wherever applicable), as they will be useful for our next simulations.
