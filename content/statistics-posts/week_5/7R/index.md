## 7_R assignament

### Request

Explain the Bayes Theorem and its key role in statistical induction. Describe the different paradigs that can be found within statistical inference (such as"bayesian", "frequentist" [Fisher, Neyman]).


### The Bayes Theorem 








### Statistical infernce paradigm
Analyse the difference between a “Bayesian” and a “frequentist” approach.

Basically, a frequentist method makes predictions on the underlying truths of the experiment using only data from the current experiment.


So, the biggest distinction is that Bayesian probability specifies that there is some prior probability.

We saw this difference during the lecture by examining the formula:


The division between the two schools of thought occurs because of the term P(θ).

We don’t have the value of the term at prior, the frequentist have chosen to ignore the term and assign it a uniform distribution, while Bayesians have chosen to use a certain already calculated shape.
